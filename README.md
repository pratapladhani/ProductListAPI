# PowerApps + Azure Lab

This repository contains a lab for demonstrating how PowerApps can be used in conjunction with Restful APIs  

## Lab Overview & Objective

### Objective

This lab has two key objectives:

- To demonstrate how PowerApps platform can help unlock the potential of untapped assets within an Enterprise ( legacy APIs, data sources, processes) with a low-code / no code approach.  
- To demonstrate how the above pattern can, in turn,  engender Azure consumption in the enterprise.  

### Overview

Most enterprises have a majority of their core business data trapped in several silos (legacy databases & apps - Systems of Records). It is essential for digital transformation to break those data silos and make the information trapped in those systems available to employees and business teams as needed.  

It is also important to modernize the user experience of the enterprise apps in order to drive productivity.  

PowerApps along with Azure could be an effective way to bridge this gap, by enabling an RESTful API layer powered by Azure which could encapsulate and standardize the enterprise data for use with apps + PowerApps as the Rapid application development User Interface where business apps can be built with agility and in collaboration with the business.

### Prerequisites
The lab requires: 
- Visual Studio 2017 or 2019 to compile the code and publish to Azure
- Access to Azure Subscription to create an API app to serve as the REST API
- Access to a PowerApps environment with permission to create apps and custom connectors
