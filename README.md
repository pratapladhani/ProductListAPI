# PowerApps + Azure Lab

This repository contains a lab for demonstrating how PowerApps can be along with Restful APIs hosted in Azure API Apps using custom connectors 

## Lab Overview & Objective

### Overview

Most enterprises have a majority of their core business data trapped in several silos (legacy databases & apps - Systems of Records). It is essential for digital transformation to break those data silos and make the information trapped in those systems available to employees and business teams as needed.  

It is also important to modernize the user experience of the enterprise apps in order to drive productivity.  

[Microsoft PowerApps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/powerapps-overview) along with [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/guides/developer/azure-developer-guide) could be an effective way to bridge this gap, by enabling an RESTful API layer powered by Azure which could encapsulate and standardize the enterprise data for use with apps + PowerApps as the rapid application development User interface where business apps can be built with agility and in collaboration with the business.

### Objectives

This lab has two key objectives:
- To demonstrate how PowerApps platform can help unlock the potential of untapped assets within an Enterprise ( legacy APIs, data sources, processes) with a low-code / no code approach.  
- Learn to create a cross-platform application user experience using Microsoft Power Apps to consume these RESTful APIs through custom connectors

### Prerequisites
The lab requires: 
- Visual Studio 2017 or 2019 to compile the code and publish to Azure
- Access to an Azure Subscription to create an API app to serve as the RESTful API
- Access to a PowerApps environment with Maker permission to create apps and custom connectors
